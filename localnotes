working on building on home pc.

so far home src is same as uni src

image magick is installed, but it doesn't find magick++.h, prob cos it's in ImageMagick/magick++.h

good luck

ok added /usr/include/ImageMagick to CMakeLists.txt

patched files in imagemagick, see notes

oglft doesn't work on home comp - got font now!

changed width and height in fullscreen windowgensdl.cpp, otherwise same as uni
